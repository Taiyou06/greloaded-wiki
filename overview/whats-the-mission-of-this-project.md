# ðŸ’¡ What's the mission of this project?

I started working on this project in Q3 of 2022. I've always had something in mind about a touhou server in minecraft. \
\
There is still a server (as far as i know) called [Yukkuri Craft](https://yukkuricraft.net/) they are more casual, laid back build server from what I've seen and I want to something in similar in casualness but as well as feature rich survival MMORPG elements with a huge map to explore, build and fight without any mods to give players the actual feel of the gensokyo!\
\
\
In the long run I want to make a fully custom touhou map and other regions like Hakugyokurou, Lunar Capital etc, rather than using the map from [Touhou Craft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/touhou-gensokyo/).\
For now server has a headcanon region called Gensokyo Caves to make more room for players.\
