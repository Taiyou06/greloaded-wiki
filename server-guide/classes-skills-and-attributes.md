# Classes, skills, & attributes

When you first join, you'll start with:

```
1 Class point
3 Skill points
1 Skill reallocation point
3 Attribute points
1 Attribute reallocation point
```

But what do all these points do? Let's find out!

## Classes & Sub-classes

One of the first things you should do is pick your class! Each class has different stats, and will gain increased bonuses in certain areas upon leveling up. After reaching level 10, you will have access to sub-classes! Think of it like an upgrade to your original class, where you branch to different stylized versions of the original.Pick one by talking to the Class Master!

_Picking a class, as well as 'upgrading' to a sub-class, will consume one class point._

### Attributes <a href="#attributes" id="attributes"></a>

Your player has 3 core attributes: <mark style="color:orange;">Strength</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">Dexterity</mark>, and <mark style="color:blue;">Intelligence</mark>. Each attribute will has give certain statistics, which will increase on level up. Each attribute can have a maximum of 40 attribute points invested in them.

_Increasing the level of an attribute will consume one attribute point._
