# ðŸª¨ Down in the caves

Deep underground lies a dark and spacious cavern, it's quite an interesting sight to see. Let's get into finding and exploring the caves!

## Accessing the cavern region

The caves are accessed by tunneling below about **-y58**, at that point you should 'feel' the transition. You'll know it when you get there! Once you're in the cave region, you'll find that everywhere is still deepslate; to get to the actual caverns, continue digging to around **y270**. Remember, _don't dig straight down_!

## Mining

The caverns provide you will a resource that every player desires: **diamonds**! If you haven't noticed, no ores are generated in the map, rather, you will find '[hidden veins](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]' of ore that will show themselves randomly as you tunnel. Diamonds are _only_ found in the caves; you don't need to be in the caverns, just within the cave region.

## Biomes/Regions

Something else you may have tried was building a nether portal and finding it doesn't work. Turns out, the Nether has migrated to the caverns! There are currently 3 (?) biomes in the caverns: forest, 'nether,' and frozen (?). You can find each by exploring, but the largest region is covered by forest.

### Forest

It has trees. Oh and there's a nice river too! The forest's main feature is that it's landscape is packed to the brim with dark oak wood! A great place to grind your woodcutting stats, but do note that mobs will be spawning everywhere; there is almost no natural light on the cavern floor, so maybe you'll be fighting more than deforesting.

### 'Nether'

Not quite the Nether, I call this biome the 'Nether' (so creative!). This biome is a more mountainous and spacious nether-like region. It's quite the sight, there's hillyterrain, lava pools, ashen trees (which are really just acacia)

[^1]: Hidden veins will do 1 of 2 things:

    * Randomly replace the surrounding stone with a couple ores.
    * Give you some common materials (sand, copper ore, gravel, etc.)
