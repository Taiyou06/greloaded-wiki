# ðŸ“ª Starting out

## Step 1 - Picking your class

This is probably one of the most important choice that you make in the begining.\
Type `/class` to see the classes and pick it to your liking.

After you picked your class there are still points to spend on different stuff.\
You have skills type `/skill` to see which skills you can open it when you get your lvl high enough.

And last of all there is `/attributes` which are side buffs.\
\
Everyone gets:

```yaml
1 Class Point
3 Skill Points
1 Skill Reallocation Point
3 Attribute Points
1 Attribute Reallocation Point
```

So make sure you choose the right class.
