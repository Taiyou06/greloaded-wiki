# ðŸ“ª Starting out

## Step 1 - Picking your class

This is probably one of the most important choice that you make in the begining.\
Type `/class` to see the classes and pick it to your liking.

After you picked your class there are still points to spend on different stuff.\
You have skills type `/skill` to see which skills you can open it when you get your lvl high enough.

And last of all theres `/attributes` which are **permanent** buffs so choose wisely.
